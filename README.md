# Memory Game Project

An interactive puzzle game that _**tests your memory.**_ It helps build focus and tracks the time and number of moves you take to complete the game.

## How To Play

* Each game will have a 4x4 grid layout having 8 pairs of cards arranged randomly each time.
* The player is expected to open one card at a time and match two cards.
* If the two open cards are not a match, they will close back up and the player would need to choose two different cards.
* If the cards are a match, they will remain open and the next two cards would need to be opened up.
* The number of moves is incremented every time 2 cards are opened.
* The game starts with 3 stars and a star is deducted after every 15 moves.

* It helps you be more attentive and improves your concentration.
* The rating system and timer encourage you to compete with yourself.

## Resources
